You need EconomyAPI to use this plugin!

All players are outside on wood planks where they are safe (no PVP).
Everywhere else, PVP is enabled.
In the mid, there is one quart block, the HotBlock.
The players can walk to it thorugh the endstones.
The player standing on the HotBlock earns about 1 coin per secound.
The real game is to hit the player from the HotBlock and get on it.
If a player gets on a nether block, he gets poison effect for 2-3 secounds.
